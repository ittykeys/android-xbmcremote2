# XBMC Remote 2

## Description

XMBC Remote 2 is an attempt to make the
old [XBMC Remote](https://github.com/freezy/android-xbmcremote) work with newer Android.
For example; fill entire screen, fix the warnings about "Might not work with your device", some way to trigger overflow menu etc.

## What works

- Everything that worked in original app except https (turned off in Manifest)

## New "features"

- New Menu button on bottom bar (for opening the old Android overflow menu)
