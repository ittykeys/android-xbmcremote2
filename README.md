# XBMC Remote 2

## Description

XMBC Remote 2 is an attempt to make the
old [XBMC Remote](https://github.com/freezy/android-xbmcremote) work with newer Android.

- Remote control

## What doesn't work

- Menu
- "Now playing", listing movies, music etc; anything that fetches data From host

It will warn about an I/O Exception: Cleartext HTTP traffic to host/ip not permitted
